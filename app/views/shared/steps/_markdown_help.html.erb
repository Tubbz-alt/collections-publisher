<pre class="small markdown-example">Paragraphs are separated by empty lines.
Use non-bulleted lists for tasks. Add any costs after the link:

[task name](/link) £10 to £20
[task name](/link)

Only use bullets to show when a task has a number of options to choose from:

- [download form option 1](/link)
- [download form option 2](/link)
- bullet with no link
