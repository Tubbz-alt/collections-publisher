          Paragraphs are separated by empty lines.
          Use non-bulleted lists for tasks. Add any costs after the link:

           [task name](/link) £10 to £20
           [task name](/link)

          Only use bullets to show when a task has a number of options to choose from:

          - [download form option 1](/link)
          - [download form option 2](/link)
          - bullet with no links

      ##What is secondary content?

      Secondary content is content which is not linked to in the step by step, but has the step by step sidebar showing on it.

      We use it for content which:

      - could help you complete a task but is not the main piece of content included in the step by step
      - is optional and not useful enough to be included in the step by step
    index:
      base_path:
        label: Add new secondary link
        hint: "For example: https://www.gov.uk/pay-vat or /bank-holidays"
